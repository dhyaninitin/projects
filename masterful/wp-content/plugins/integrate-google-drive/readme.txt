== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use multiple Google Drive accounts? =
Yes, you can link to multiple Google Drive accounts to Integrate Google Drive plugin.

= Are there any usage limits? =
If you want to stream any media files (Audio, Video), the files will be streamed directly from Google Drive. So there are no bandwidth or file size issues for your web host.

But, when you download any zip files, these files will be downloaded to your site and can generate some traffic.

= Documents preview not working? =
In order to preview documents, the files should have the sharing permission "Anyone with link can view". The plugin will automatically change the sharing permission.

However, in some case the plugin isn't able to manage the sharing permissions even with those setting enabled. In that case, please try to set the sharing permissions manually via the native Google Drive interface.
